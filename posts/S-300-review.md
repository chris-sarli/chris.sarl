Providence's first experience with bikeshare was less than ideal.

The full history of that first bikeshare is too long and complicated to cover here, but it lasted 11 months from September 2018 to August 2019 and was operated by JUMP, then a subsidiary of Uber. JUMP's bikes were great for a quick trip to pick up some groceries, to zip across town to a meeting, or just to go for a joy ride. The motor was helpful for getting from point A to point B quickly and for climbing hills, but it was also *fun.* The whole experience of being able to walk up to a bike, rent it, ride it, lock it, and forget about it was liberating and delightful. Fun and practical for me as a transit and bike nerd, but also fun and practical for my friends who weren't, and fun for my mom, who hadn't ridden a bike in city traffic in years.

But less than a year after they first appeared, the bikes were pulled. JUMP's original prices ($2 for 30 minutes plus 7¢ for every additional minute) had been set so low that they weren't sustainable, and in an effort to be profitable they had jacked the prices up significantly. Around the same time, JUMP replaced their original bikes with a new version, which had more flexible but theoretically less robust locking mechanism.[^theoretically] Vandalism (breaking the locks and disabling the GPS locators) increased to levels the company hadn't seen in its other markets.

Crime and nuisance were also linked to JUMP's bikes. There were surely some minor infractions (blocking a sidewalk, riding too close to a pedestrian, that sort of thing), but a handful (out of hundreds of thousands of bike trips) of particularly bad incidents were magnified, and these events quickly snowballed into [some rather sensationalized local news coverage](https://www.wpri.com/news/local-news/providence/jump-bikes-being-used-for-crimes-is-a-serious-problem/) that implied a slight but definite link between the bikes and breakdown of social order. Some of the incidents warranted outrage and concern (for example, a JUMP technician was threatened by a man with a gun while on the job), but the tone taken by politicians and local news outlets in responding to those issues implied a causal relationship between bikes and crime that has never existed.[^projo-good-clean-fun] It was lazy and pandering, and I hope our leaders and media will not repeat that particular mistake when issues inevitably arise with Spin's bikeshare.

Facing the backlash over the misuse of its bikes and unexpected pricing change, JUMP pulled its bikes in August 2019. In February 2020, [*The Providence Journal* reported JUMP was planning to return](https://www.providencejournal.com/news/20200207/jump-bikes-returning-to-providence-in-spring) that spring, but the pandemic appears to have cancelled that. [Uber sold JUMP to Lime](https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/7/21250420/lime-funding-uber-deal-alphabet-scooter-jump-bike) and was then [caught destroying tens of thousands of the bikes](https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/27/21271927/uber-jump-bike-scooter-scrap-photos-video-lime-junkyard) it was left with. JUMP, as a brand and product, is dead.

But there's a new bikeshare in town: [Spin.](https://spin.app) I spent a week trying out their offering, and then significantly longer than a week writing this post. I've evaluated both the [new S-300 electric bike](https://www.spin.app/blog-posts/spin-goes-multimodal-adding-s-300-electric-bike-to-its-vehicle-portfolio) itself and the app and experience around using that bike, and also have some thoughts on Spin as a company and the future of bikeshare in small cities like Providence.

## The Bike

One's experience using a bike is very much dependent upon their body. I am one person with one body to test the S-300 with, so here are some of my physical statistics that may be helpful in putting my experiences in context. I'm male, 21 years old, about 6 feet tall, weigh about 155 pounds, have normalish proportions, no notable medical conditions, and ride a [2014 Trek 7.3 FX](https://archive.trekbikes.com/us/en/2014/Trek/7_3_fx#/us/en/2014/Trek/7_3_fx/details) almost every day as a primary form of transportation.

I have limited experience with electric bikes (mostly my experience with JUMP), and this is *not* going to be super technical review of the motors and battery tech. I'm sure there are plenty of websites that review those things, but this is not one of them.

### Step-Through Frame

Like every bikeshare bike I've ever seen, the S-300 uses a [step-through frame](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Step-through_frame). I've never had a problem swinging my leg over a crossbar, but these are shared bikes and step-through frames are accessible to the greatest number of people. It's the right choice, and I certainly didn't have any problems with being able to mount and dismout the bike. I only tested the S-300 while wearing my everyday cargo shorts or jeans, so I can't speak to how difficult riding might be when wearing a skirt or dress, but nothing jumped out to me as problematic in this regard.

The "downtube" is *very* thick, as it contains the battery, other electronics, and internal wiring. Fortunately, the joints connecting this component to the rest of the frame neat and well made. The rest of the frame is sturdy and mostly unremarkable, which is a good thing. I will note, however, that because the downtube is so thick and contains such a large battery, the S-300 has a weight distribution that feels very uneven if you're used to a regular bike. I barely noticed this when riding (the motor does a good job of compensating) but did feel that unexpected weight when making tight turns or sharply avoiding potholes. When standing still, the weight is much more noticeable. The bike is big and trying to maneuver it into or out of a bike rack with all that awkward weight can be annoying, if not physically challenging. I found the most physically difficult part of using the S-300 wasn't riding but trying to tuck it neatly into bike racks and getting the locking mechanism lined up. Additionally, when coming to a stop at a red light and standing to stretch my legs, I had to be careful about how I rested the bike. When riding my own bike, I'll often tilt to one side and let the bike rest on my leg, but the weight of the S-300 meant I had to remember to hold the bike. This weight (and weight distribution) is certainly less pleasant than that of any other bike (electric or otherwise) that I've ever ridden, but it isn't a huge deal.

There are a number of deeply recessed screws (presumably used in servicing the motor, gears, and battery) in the frame. These screws appear to use a variety of different sizes and head types, presumably to reduce the chance that a vandal or thief has the tools needed to access those internals. In the same vein, it's worth noting that all cabling is internally routed through the frame. Many bikeshares (including JUMP) have used this design decision as well; it keeps the appearance clean, the components somewhat isolated from bad weather, and mischievous vandals (who may take sadistic pleasure in cutting brake cables) out.

{% caption 'The S-300 has deeply recessed screws, presumably to deter vandals.' %}

### Locking and Unlocking

As I mentioned earlier, there's been a lot of talk about bikeshare locking mechanisms in Providence. On the S-300, the lock consists of a long, rubberized cable that is secured to the rear fender assembly just behind the saddle post. The cable ends in a long pin that is inserted into a lock hole on the right side of the rear fender assembly. The pin is long enough that it can be pushed all the way through the bike to activate a sensor on the left of the assembly, which presumably tells the bike's computer the lock's status. When unlocked, the rider routes the cable into a groove along the top of the rear fender and inserts the pin into another hole towards the back of the fender (this hole also has a sensor, and the bike can beep and chirp to indicate whether you've properly inserted the pin).

At the press conference, this lock design was touted as making the bike much more secure, and much was said about how bad JUMP's design had been. But, as I remarked on Twitter at the time, those statements were somewhat misleading:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Pretty misleading statement on the design of JUMP’s lock design. The *first* version had a removable bracket, but the second version (the one that caused all the “problems”) had the *same* basic design as Spin.<br><br>(Photos, in order, JUMP v1, JUMP v2, Spin) <a href="https://t.co/lV2j03Ducg">https://t.co/lV2j03Ducg</a> <a href="https://t.co/NNiXVfGRQZ">pic.twitter.com/NNiXVfGRQZ</a></p>&mdash; Chris Sarli (@chris_sarli) <a href="https://twitter.com/chris_sarli/status/1404563179754201097?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 14, 2021</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

The S-300's lock is, on the conceptual level, the same as the lock on the second JUMP design (the one that seemed to cause so much trouble). But I do think there are some differences which probably *do* make it more secure. The cable feels a bit tougher than JUMP's did. I wouldn't trust it over a sturdy U-Lock for my own personal bike, but it isn't terrible. The pin is also much longer than I remember the locking pin on JUMP's design being. My guess is that this makes the lock more resilient to blunt force attacks that JUMP's bikes were said to be vulnerable to.

But that added security comes with some tradeoffs. Routing the cable along the fender is clever, but it's still a big floppy cable that you have to route into place. JUMP's second bike had a more flexible braided cable that retracted into the bike. This was much more pleasant than the big floppy cable on the S-300, which can feel somewhat unwieldy. Another disadvantage of this is that you have to insert the lock on the right side of the bike. The bike is heavy and can be hard to get lined up next to a rack, so turning it around and shifting things to get the hole and pin aligned can be somewhat irritating. The original JUMP bike I had U-Lock style mechanism that could be inserted from either the left or right, which is a convenience I wish the S-300 had.

I also found (once, out of the six trips I took on the S-300) that the lock can get stuck. I had parked the bike and inserted the lock as far as it would go. Noticing that the bike hadn't chirped its confirmation that my ride had ended (confirmed by a glance at the Spin app), I realized that there was still a bit of the metal pin visible. I tried rotating the rear wheel to ensure that I hadn't hit a spoke and tried backing the pin out and trying again, but it was stuck. Too far in to take it out, but not far enough in to convince the bike that I had ended my ride. I spent a few minutes trying to dislodge the lock, scoured the app to see if there was a way to send a force unlock command to the bike (there wasn't), and ultimately decided to give up. I had stuff to do and ended up walking home. I submitted a support ticket, an experience you can read about more [below.](#customer-service)

I'm also worried that others might be having difficulties with the lock. In the past several weeks walking around Providence, I've seen at least two strangers (out of the maybe 15-20 total people I've seen riding an S-300) clearly struggling with the mechanism. This, of course, is anecdotal evidence of course, and its reasonable to assume that these people had never unlocked an S-300 before. And though I wish the lock was a bit more intuitive, it's not like other docked solutions (CitiBike comes to mind) are super easy to use.

Obviously, I didn't try to break into the S-300, so I can't really evaluate how secure the lock is, but generally I think Spin succeeded in creating a *more* secure dockless bikeshare bike. It definitely isn't close to unbreakable, but nothing is.

### Saddle

The saddle is rider-adjustable and secured with a fairly standard clamping mechanism, which felt sturdy enough such that I wasn't worried about the S-300 being able to support my weight. The FCC compliance label on the side of the bike claims it has a maximum payload of 264 pounds, so I assume that the clamp is rated to hold that much weight. Because the S-300 is intended to be a shared bike, the saddle height will need to be adjusted frequently, so I wish that it was a bit easier to (de)tension the clamp. Of course, I'd rather have the security of a strong clamp that's hard to open then a weak clamp that is easy to open, but even modifying the clamp arm (currently a somewhat thing and sharp-edged metal strip) to be a bit more grippable would be a welcome change.

I'm very glad to see that the saddle posts have different height adjustments marked with numbers. Because it's expected that riders will frequently want to adjust the saddle height when they start a ride, this feature respects the fact that repeat riders will learn over time which height works best for them by allowing them to consistently dial in that height. The saddle post has its rotation fixed by a small metal ridge that keeps the saddle directly facing forward (which is fine), but I'm worried that this makes it a bit difficult to adjust the height (the post can seem to get stuck, meaning I had to use sometimes a lot of force to get the saddle to the precise height I wanted).

![S-300 Saddle Post](/img/spin-saddle-post.jpg "The S-300 Saddle Post")
{% caption 'The S-300 has different heights marked on the saddle post, which helps riders dial in their preferred height on subsequent rides.' %}

As for the saddle itself, I do wish there was a drainage hole or two (or at least a slightly less convex shape), because water can easily pool. But, when the saddle was dry, I found it to be serviceable for short rides. It's softer than the rather hard saddle I'm used to on my own bike, but I wouldn't call it "soft." I got a little sore after about 30 minutes of continuous riding, but everyone will have different preferences on this.

On a longer ride, I noticed that the saddle is much wider than the saddle I'm used to, especially towards the rear. I didn't think much of this at first, but after a while I found that it was so wide it was interfering with my thighs while pedaling. Again, this will vary for each individual, but I started to feel my inner thighs not just rubbing but hitting the saddle with every pedal and found this to be very distracting and unpleasant. I hadn't noticed this in shorter, faster-paced rides I had taken, so maybe it had to do with my posture, but I had never run into that on any other saddle I've ever ridden.

### Basket

The S-300's handlebar-mounted basket is a disappointment. Certainly it's better than no basket, but it's almost frustratingly small. Spin, in a [press release,](https://www.spin.app/blog-posts/keep-it-s-300-introducing-the-spin-s-300-e-bike) says they want us to use it to carry the stuff of everyday life:
> It’s robust front storage compartment handles groceries and deliveries with ease

Providence is a city of many hills, potholes, and terrible drivers. I'm not sure where the S-300 was designed and tested, but I find it very hard to imagine anyone feeling good about transporting groceries through Providence in this basket. I've carried precarious loads (several watermelons, pizzas, water jugs, glassware) on bikes before, and have always felt reasonably comfortable doing so because I've had a deep enough container (a milk crate in the case of the watermelon), bungees and straps, or both. The S-300 has a relatively shallow basket with no built-in way of strapping down the contents of that basket. I'm sure the basket can support up to its 17.6-pound capacity when stationary, but once in motion I have very little confidence that the contents would stay inside.

The basket is mounted on the handlebars, and reminds me of a pinball flipper when the front wheel gets a jolt (again, Providence has many potholes). I tried riding for about 5 minutes with a tote bag containing about 4 pounds of groceries in the basket, and while everything stayed in the basket, there were a few close calls even though I was riding more slowly than I otherwise would have. If I felt that uneasy about carrying $7 of vegetables, there's no way in hell I'm trusting that basket with something valuable like my bookbag.

I really think Spin needs to go back to the drawing board on this one. Every other bikeshare I've used has had a better basket than this. JUMP had nice, deep baskets that I always felt confident using for groceries. Heck, [CitiBike has some models](https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2018/08/07/new-citi-bikes-with-bigger-baskets-hit-the-streets-today/) with baskets even smaller and shallower than the S-300, but because they include a bungee cords, I've always felt at least somewhat comfortable using them.

### Drivetrain and Motors

The S-300 uses chain drives, and all gearing is handled internally. Most of the chain is covered, with only the bottom of the chain exposed. I tested the bikes when they were brand new, so the chains seemed to be quiet and clean, and I'm hopeful Spin will be able to maintain this level of quality as the bikes are used and abused in all four seasons of Providence weather.

![S-300 Gears](/img/spin-gears.jpg "The S-300 Rear Gear Hub")

Because the bottom of the chain loop is exposed, I was initially worried about pants legs getting caught or greasy. After testing, I don't think this is a huge concern. The pedals are positioned fairly far from the chain and front cog, and the upper part of the cog is separated from the world (and the rider's legs) by the external shell of the bike. When I'm riding my regular bike in jeans, I usually roll up my right pants leg just so that if the pants *do* get grease on them, I can easily hide it. I didn't feel like this precaution was needed on the S-300, but other clothing types may warrant different considerations. In the future, Spin could go above and beyond by equipping their bikes either with full chain guards or belt drive systems, but the lack of either doesn't detract from the S-300.

All gear changes are handled by the bike itself, meaning there is no gear shifter that could cause problems. I've been shifting my own gears for most of my life, so it feels a bit weird not to be able to control the power-to-rotation ratio (especially when purposefully riding slowly, like when creeping up to a red light), but for the most part the shifting handled itself as advertised. You can still feel the shifting when the motor changes power level, but it's much smoother than shift on JUMP's bike was.

The S-300 uses a Segway system for the battery and motors. I don't know much of anything about how good Segway is at these things, but the handling of the S-300 leads me to believe that the company lives up at least somewhat to its brand image. There are hub motors in both the front and rear wheels, and the timing is good enough that it feels as though the two motors are one. They respond as I naturally expect when I change my pedaling cadence, and at top speeds the motors seem to output steady, continuous power. I regularly find myself at red lights with angry motorists right behind me, so I welcome the near-instant acceleration the S-300 can provide. It is wonderful and I wish I could add it to my bike as a "turbo button" for those situations. But because I'm often stuck in traffic while biking, I sometimes found myself wishing for the option of *not* accidentally activating that acceleration while just pedaling to stay upright. Probably something best to leave out on a bike designed for everyone, but certainly something I thought about as a bike person.

### Wheels and Tires

The S-300 has reasonably thick 26-inch tires, which seem fairly standard for bikeshare bikes. There are also white reflectors ringing each side of each tire. I've been seeing these more and more on bikes, and I very much like it. These reflectors signal a bikes presence very distinctively when illuminated at night, and they also look nice too.

![S-300 Tire](/img/spin-tire.jpg "The S-300 Tire")

The wheels are interesting. Spin is using wheels with 12 "spokes," paired to give the impression of 6 "spokes." I'm almost certain that these were selected over standard wheels because it makes it much easier to lock. The locking mechanism (discussed later) relies on putting a long metal pin through the rear wheel. Leaving more large, empty space in the wheel means that users are much less likely to hit the spoke when locking the bike, probably reducing maintenance costs of broken spokes and reducing user frustration.

Riders are shielded from both the front and rear wheels by fenders. Given Providence's often less than ideal weather, these are a must. In my testing, they did a better job than I expected, but the bottoms of my legs still got a bit wet when riding after a storm. I'm sure that if Providence had fewer potholes, less impermeable surface area, better drainage systems, and fewer cars constantly splashing water then this would be much less of a problem, but if you're riding a bike in Providence when it's raining, you're probably getting at least a little wet, and your shoes are probably getting coated with sand and other road grit.

### Lights and Reflectors

The S-300 is equipped with two LED lights that are powered from the internal battery. As is standard for bikeshares, the white headlight is mounted in front of the handlebars and the red taillight is incorporated into the rear fender. These lights are sufficient, if unremarkable. Spin says both are visible from 500ft away. I have no way of testing this, but it doesn't sound unreasonable. I did notice that for its brightness the beam of the headlight was wider than I expected it to be, illuminating both some of the roadway and street signs.

![S-300 Headlight](/img/spin-headlight.jpg "The S-300 Headlight and Front Reflector")

The red taillight and rear reflector are also fine, if unremarkable.

![S-300 Taillight](/img/spin-taillight.jpg "The S-300 Taillight and Rear Reflector")

In terms of reflectors, I've mentioned my fondness for the tire wall reflector rings. Complementing those are standard pedal reflectors, plus a standard white retroreflector on the front to complement the headlight. Like JUMP, Spin has branded with a reddish color. Neither JUMP or Spin use a reflective or neon paint, but both are vibrant (JUMP more so than Spin) and likely to be more quickly identified than a bike painted only in grays would.

### Handlebars

The handlebars are good enough, for me at least. They felt comfortable enough and a good width, but otherwise unremarkable (again, not in a bad way). Like saddle height, the configuration of handlebars has a big impact on the experience of the rider. Spin hasn't included a way for riders to adjust this, likely because that would significantly increase the overall complexity of the bike and have instead opted to aim for a setting that most will find usable. I think they did a pretty good job.

![S-300 Dashboard](/img/spin-dash.jpg "The S-300 Dashboard Area")

In the center of the handlebars is what I'll call the "control cluster." The top portion is a phone holder, and the top lip of the assembly can be expanded forwards to adjust to most phone sizes. The mechanism is forced backwards by an internal spring, securing the rider's phone as a type of dashboard... in theory. Personally, I don't feel like this spring is strong enough that I would feel comfortable trusting it with my phone, especially given the jolts a Providence pothole can send through the bike.

And even if I felt it was secure enough, I don't think I'd *want* my phone to be mounted. Despite [the City's efforts](https://www.providenceri.gov/planning/great-streets/), Providence is still a fairly dangerous place to bike, in part because we have so many terrible drivers who themselves are distracted by phones when they shouldn't be. I get that it might be helpful if you're trying to use your phone as a navigator, but in general I *like* not looking at my phone while riding.

 In the event you *do* want to clamp in your phone, the bike can wirelessly charge your phone through the Qi standard, as indicated by a small label on the surface your phone would sit. Above that is some unoffensive Spin branding and a QR code used in unlocking the bike. Because the code is under a shiny layer of plastic. Rainwater or glaring sun can make it difficult to get a clear read of the code, which would be solved if they had used a sticker instead. There's an additional code on the down tube that is easier to get a read from.

 Below that, there are three icons, presumably a crossed circle to indicate "no," a snail to indicate "slow," and a parking symbol. Below this is a speed display, using standard 8-segment digit displays. I found this to be a clear and easily readable display, even in direct sun.

 Below the speed display is lettering indicating an NFC reader. I thought this was an odd choice, because while *I* am a nerd and know that NFC is Near Field Communication, and means you should tap a think there, most people don't know what this acronym indicates (which I believe is a tag that can be used for phone-less unlock, discussed later). This seems like an odd choice, because most NFC readers people interact with use at least some symbology to indicate wireless communication upon tap, usually with sideways waves (like on this credit card reader at CVS).

 Below this is a multicolor glowing light, which I think is a nice, fun touch. When locked and available it glows green, which seems like a natural choice for "available." But when it is in a ride, it glows pinkish/purple. I have nothing against these colors, but for the life of me I cannot figure out if there is some meaning behind this color choice (these are the sorts of things that keep me up at night.)

 There is no user-controlled gear shifting on the handlebars, or on the entire bike for that matter, which makes the handlebars much simpler and likely more resilient to weather and regular wear-and-tear. There is a bell that can be rung by twisting a ring in either direction, very similar to most bikeshare bell mechanisms I used. The bell itself is sufficient and distinctive, but I wish it were a bit louder (traffic can be loud, and cars are increasingly well sound isolated).

### Brakes

Attached to the handlebars are two brake levers. As is standard on many bikes, the left lever corresponds to the front wheel and the right the rear. I felt that the brakes were, while sufficient, a bit soft for my preference. If I need to brake *right now* then I want to feel that feedback in the levers, and the breaks on the Spin Bikes I tested felt a bit mushy. I was able to lock up the rear wheel a few times, but I only know that because I heard the scraping and felt slight fishtailing, not because of the tactile feedback in the levers. I should note that I've found the brakes on every bikeshare I've ever tried to be a bit mushy for my taste, so this isn't an S-300-specific complaint.

The brakes themselves are probably fine for a bikeshare and casual or leisurely riders, but I ride in traffic and would personally like something a bit stronger. For example, the first time I was testing the bike I was riding down Westminster Street in light rain when the car in front of me had to abruptly stop. I slammed on the brakes but still gently collided with their rear bumper. I was fine, the car was fine, no massive lawsuit ensued, so no big deal. But still, I felt that if I had been on my own bike, I might have stopped a little sooner and not collided. It may have been a combination of operator (my) error in being distracted or following too closely or the slick surface, but this isn't an unrealistic scenario. I would like it if the brakes gave me maybe 10-15% more confidence than they currently do.

### Overall Aesthetic

Maybe it's just that bikeshare (and electric bikeshare too) aren't brand new anymore (and that I look at lots of pictures of bikeshares), but Spin's bikes have a generic sort of look. The <span style="background-color: #ed6044; padding: 0 6px 0 6px; border-radius: 12px; color:white;">orange</span> color and slanted logo they've branded their company (and by extension, these bikes) with is passable and unoffensive. The <span style="background-color: #373f4a; padding: 0 6px 0 6px; border-radius: 12px; color:white;">gray</span> they've used as the base color seems like it could be sold in a paint store as "default dark gray." I don't think I'd really think about this on most bikeshare bikes, but between the huge battery and the rear fender (which doubles as a deterrent to would-be vandals), the S-300 has a visual presence that looks heavy. We're accustomed to seeing bikes as rather lightweight-looking things (even if the bike is made of steel and very heavy, the tubes are generally pretty thin), so most electric bikes look a little bulky. The S-300 has a big battery and shielding, so it has a *lot* of bulk. I think Spin should try to do a better job of hiding that bulk or leaning into it.

JUMP, for example, had picked a very unique <span style="background-color: #e83824; padding: 0 6px 0 6px; border-radius: 12px; color:white;">reddish</span> color and covered its somewhat bulky bikes with it. That choice signaled that they *chose* a distinctive color for an exciting new product, and that color stood out on city streets, but it also looked strangely natural. JUMP's bike wasn't as bulky as the S-300, so Spin probably has a harder challenge here, but I think they should spend some time and attention in this. Right now I'd describe the S-300 as looking utilitarian, but not a particularly pleasing shade of utilitarian.

It's certainly more important that the S-300 works and that Spin's user experience is pleasant than it is that the bikes look nice, but while looks aren't everything, they also aren't nothing. For one, it's important for getting people to try bikeshare out. *I* always prefer to take my bike or the bus to get where I'm going, but lots of people prefer to drive, and the fact that a growing number of Americans will make financially moronic decisions so that they can drive "luxury" vehicles is evidence that appearance in mobility matters at least a little. Functionality matters more, but Spin can encourage a lot more people to try bikeshare if it can convince them that they'd look attractive riding it.

## The Service

### Pricing

It's an unavoidable fact that for single rides (meaning you purchase a single trip, not a membership or pass), Spin's offering is expensive.

Spin's pricing for its bikes is the same as its scooters,[^scooter-comparison] $1 to unlock plus 29¢ per every minute the trip lasts. Relative to other North American[^domestic] bikeshares (even other electric bikeshares), the cost of a single trip is fairly high. You can compare the costs for a single ride on a number of bikeshares here:

JUMP's original pricing was a great deal, at $2 for 30 minutes of ride time, and then 7¢ per each additional minute. As mentioned, this pricing was *too* good a deal, and was not sustainable for the company. This was intentional; the company wanted people to buy in to the idea of bikeshare before raising prices in efforts to become profitable. When JUMP did raise its prices, it made the bikes "free to unlock" (rather patronizing marketing, in my opinion) and 30¢ per minute. In effect, the cost of the average trip skyrocketed. Because of this bait-and-switch tactic, lots of existing JUMP users (myself included) were [rather upset.](https://www.providencejournal.com/news/20190715/providence-riders-dismayed-at-leaping-cost-of-jump-bike-rentals) (JUMP did revise its pricing model to lower the average ride cost, but shortly after the change the bikes were pulled completely.) Spin's pricing model makes all trips under an hour more expensive than they would be under even JUMP's most controversial model, so at least Spin seems to be more responsible in setting expectations.

A fairly standard use case might be to use a Spin Bike (or scooter) for two 15-minute trips a day, five days a week. At Spin's prices, this works out to $53.50 a week. Fortunately, Spin offers daily ($) and weekly ($30) passes that allow for unlimited rides of unlimited duration while the rides are active. If you're planning on riding even a little, then you should absolutely purchase one of these passes. They make the cost of individual rides look absolutely ridiculous: you save with the $30 weekly pass if you ride for more than an hour and 45 minutes.

But just because they passes make single trip pricing look high, that doesn't make Spin Passes cheap. Weekly Spin Passes for 50 weeks out of a year will set you back $1,500. At this price, you can buy an ebike of your own (maybe not a high-end model, but certainly something sturdy and reliable). But, some might say, part of the appeal of bikeshare is that you don't *need* to own a bike and deal with maintaining it, storing it, or worrying about it getting stolen. These are certainly factors to weigh, and they'll vary by individual, but I think it's worth noting that Spin's unlimited passes are still notably more expensive than other bikeshares.

CitiBike, for instance, offers an annual membership for $179 which includes unlimited 45-minute rides on regular bikes (ebikes usage is an additional 12¢ per minute). Divvy has a similar model, $108 for a year of unlimited 45-minute rides (ebikes are an additional 15¢ per minute). In Boston, an annual BlueBikes membership costs $109 up-front and provides the same unlimited 45-minute rides. And, in cities like New York and Chicago where the electric option is somewhat expensive (even for annual members), there are alternative options. You don't always need or even want the electric assist when riding, so in these cities the choice is welcome. It might be, unfortunately, that Providence's market is too small or insufficiently dense to support these options, meaning that the one option of bikes we might have will always be the one with the broadest appeal: the expensive S-300.

Finally, there's Spin Access. Access is marketed as a suite of benefits, including methods that let individuals without smartphones, location access, credit cards, access the service and the ability to issue steep discounts to financially constrained individuals. Currently Spin has a plan that lets qualifying individuals have unlimited rides for $blah per month. Compared to the regular prices, these are fantastic. One of the key promises of bikeshare is that it promotes equity in transportation, so it is absolutely vital that Spin offers this.

That said, even if Access is a great deal for people with demonstrable need, it doesn't do much good if not many qualifying individuals take advantage of it. At the end of the day, Spin is a business. Spin *may* derive financial benefits by promoting equity and offering steep discounts (it could, for example, receive good contracts and valuable municipal support as a result), but I think it would be irresponsible *not* to be at least a little skeptical of the profit motive. Ultimately, the City will need to be vigilant in ensuring that Spin is fulfilling its aspirations.

### User Interface and User Experience

Software is hard, so I'm not expecting the experience of opening an app, tapping a button, having my credit card charged, and an e-bike unlocking itself to happen flawlessly every time. But, that said, I've noticed a number of bugs and inconsistencies in Spin's app that give me concern. Spin has been around since 2017 and been owned by Ford since 2018. Most of the issues I've experienced don't totally impair usability of the service, but there are a lot of rough edges that I would expect from a startup, but not from a company with partnerships in many cities and access to Ford's deep pockets.

I tested Spin's iOS app on an iPhone 12 Mini running the latest version of the operating system. It works most of the time, but the design and interaction are less than pleasant. The primary interface element, a map showing available vehicles, is particularly bad given its prominence.

Spin uses Google Maps as the provider for its map information and tiles. On iOS, I've never liked Google Maps' API offering. Personal preference here, but I think Google Maps' cartography has gotten uglier over the years, and while Spin seems to have modified that styling somewhat, it weird blueish tint every element of the map seems to have feels a bit off. Additionally, the map Google's views it produces are generally much less smooth than those produced by Apple's MapKit, and that seems to hold true in this case too: panning and zooming around the map is noticeably jittery. I've also had the app crash several times while panning around the map.

On top of that, Spin draws custom pins for each of its vehicles that are available to rent. I think it's nice to show vehicle type and battery level, but they've made each pin rather large, with an opaque background and a drop shadow, such that it's really hard to parse the differences when lots of vehicles clumped together. Honestly, if you're just looking for a map of current scooter and bike locations, I'd just use the excellent [Transit app](https://transitapp.com) (which can show Spin's availability in addition to realtime transit information or rideshare pickup times) or the [GBFS Viewer](https://chris.sarl/GBFS-Viewer/) I built a few years ago.

![Clumped Pins](/img/clumped-pins.png "Clumped Pins")
{% caption 'Pins are really hard to see when lots are close together. Is there a bike in that mess? Who knows!' %}

There are also some green pins indicating areas where you can park to earn free credits towards future rides (this helps Spin balance the distribution of bikes and scooters throughout the city), but again, these pins are too large and obscure too much of the map when zoomed out. Spin should really just shamelessly copy what Transit does, which is shrink these types of pins to little dots when the map view is sufficiently zoomed out.

Also on the map are a number of polygons. The largest, only visible when zoomed out, is green and demarcates the system's service area, which is the border of the municipality. Inside, a number of smaller, red-tinted polygons mark areas where riders are not allowed to park and/or ride. I'll cover the implications of these polygons later, but visually they don't look very good. The styling uses fairly unnatural looking colors, and when the red overlays the green, the map looks tinted in brown. The shapes themselves look sloppy as well. Even if Spin had some technical and ugly boundaries "under the hood," I assume that they are passing the Google Maps API standard [GeoJSON](https://geojson.org). At the very least, Spin could generate better-looking and more accurate GeoJSON from the shapefiles provided by the [City](https://pvdgis.maps.arcgis.com/home/index.html) and [State](https://www.rigis.org).

Ok, enough of me getting angry about maps.

The main interface of the app has four floating icons, one in each corner, one for the ["hamburger button,"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamburger_button) one to earn free rides (by generating and sharing personal promo codes), one to center the map on your current location, and one (displayed as an exclamation mark) to report an issue. Each of these icons are unintuitive and frustrating to me. Visually, it isn't clear in what each button does without tapping on it, and because they hang out on the corners of the map, they add visual clutter (I'm looking at you, promo code button) to the map view, already cluttered by all those pins.

When you do tap one of these buttons and try to navigate through the app, all of the controls are custom, so they don't look and work like I expect controls in an iOS app to (presumably the same is true in the Android app as well). I can't, for example, swipe from the left edge of a screen to go back in a menu of options, which I can do almost everywhere on my phone. Because of this, the app itself feels broken, or at the very least it feels buggy and half-baked. Yes, it's a little thing that most people won't think about, but I always try to take care when writing software to respect things like this because not doing so does subtly make users think that the app is "wrong," even if it works.

Fortunately, the most important interaction with the app is solid. At the bottom of the main map view, there is a big orange RIDE button. Tapping it brings up a QR code scanner right away, which will quickly unlock an S-300 once it gets a clear read. The app presents some messages about riding safely that most people will never read and a thumbs-up thumbs-down survey of whether the bike had been parked neatly.

When done riding, you must end the ride from the bike itself by reinserting the locking mechanism until the bike beeps. Unfortunately, Spin really wants you take a picture of your parking job after you end the ride. They do this because lots of selfish people who left to their own devices would park the bikes (and scooters) wherever they felt like, even if that blocked a sidewalk, door, ramp, or what have you. Taking a picture serves as a nudge to riders to be slightly less selfish and can be used by Spin to establish a pattern of irresponsible behavior that may get a rider banned from their service.

I get why they do this, but it's really frustrating to responsible riders like myself. Taking a photo isn't some huge inconvenience, but it adds a little papercut to each ride, especially if you lock the bike and start to walk away without taking your phone out. You can choose not to submit a photo, but this could "count against you" (it's probably nothing, but I'm a sucker and I want to make the app happy.) I shelled out $30 for a weekly pass while writing this review; if I did that more than a few consecutive weeks, I'd hope Spin could keep track of that and reward my loyalty with trusting me to respect others.

### The App Should Be Optional

Of all the bikeshare bikes I've ridden, my favorite was the first JUMP design that graced the streets of Providence. It was my favorite for exactly one reason: the keypad. That design included a 10-digit keypad and small, low-tech display on the rear wheel. Through JUMP's app, you could enter your phone number and enter a passcode, and then walk up to any locked and available JUMP bike and *without taking your phone out* punch in your number and code and the bike would unlock and start a trip.

I've talked about this with many people and have never found anyone else who cares about this nearly as much as I do, but it is a stellar feature. Is it pouring rain, and you don't want to take your phone out? No problem. The keypad buttons suck, but they work in the rain. Is it the dead of winter and the last thing you want to do is take off your mittens so you can work your phone? It's possible (if not pleasant) to punch those digits in with those mittens on. Maybe it's late, the bus has stopped running, and you can't hail a rideshare or call a cab because your phone is dead, and either you're unlocking that bike or it's an hour to walk home? Well, as long as you can remember those numbers, you've got a ride.

Smartphones are great, but counting them as an absolute dependency is dangerous. The clearest example of this, of course, is people who don't have smartphones because they can't afford them or simply don't want them. JUMP did and Spin (in the form of Spin Access) does offer an option for these people, but I'd argue that they should make a phone-less experience available for all users, because even if you have a smartphone, you can't guarantee that it will always be charged and never be lost or stolen. Give us a key fob, let us punch in numbers, whatever, just don't always make me pull out my phone just to ride a bike.

I'll return to this theme that a smartphone should not always be the key to transportation later, when I discuss something.

### Customer Service

[Earlier,](#locking-and-unlocking) when I mentioned my experience with the jammed lock, I said I had contacted support. In the app, I had found the "I have a problem" page, and I tried to start a live chat (which was listed as one of the options). Despite being listed, though, it seems that this feature has not rolled out yet, because instead of bringing up the chat interface, the app redirected me to a generic-looking help page saying they would be "launching a new and improved FAQ page shortly," and inviting me to send me an email or submit a support ticket through the app and await an asynchronous response. I chose the latter option, and a few hours later got a very nice email apologizing for the email and offering to refund me for most of the trip (during which time the bike was immobile). I responded the next day, saying that I didn't care about the refund (I had been using an unlimited ride pass so I wasn't charged in the first place), but I did offer to send photos and video of the jammed lock I had taken in the event that it would be helpful to the design or maintenance teams. Unfortunately, I never got a follow-up reply to this offer.

In the end, the customer service was as quick and courteous as I would expect, though I do think it would have been nice if my offer to share photos of the mechanical issue had been at the least politely declined. My biggest complaint again goes back to the app feeling half-baked. Rolling out new features is hard, but Spin has deep pockets backing it. Plus, they've been running a micromobility service in Providence for over a year now, so it's surprising that the support experience is still so rough around the edges.

## The Company and The City

Beyond the S-300 itself and the service that supports it, I'm including this section as a hodgepodge of

### Breaking the Rules

Naturally, bikeshares have rules that wouldn't apply to a personal bike. Some of them are inherent to the fact that the none of the S-300s I rode were property: I'm free to destroy my own bike (though I can't imagine why I'd do that), but of course I can't vandalize an S-300. Within the parameters of the user agreement (and common decency) I also can't paint it, keep it in my apartment (depriving others of the ability to use it), or disable the GPS tracker on it.

There are some other rules in renting an S-300 that arise not strictly because I don't own the bike, but because the bike is part of a system. Rules like *when* I can rent the bike and *where* I can ride it.

#### Time Restrictions

Let's handle the *when* first. Per [City Regulations,](https://www.providenceri.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/City-of-Providence-Micromobility-Regulations-as-of-9.25.20.pdf) Spin can only operate between 5AM and 10PM. I'm not sure what the reasoning behind this is, but I'd like to see it expanded to 24/7 service. Bikeshare needs to compete with rideshare and personal car ownership, and it needs to be able to do so at all hours.

As part of my testing, I took the S-300 on a [Providence Bike Jam](https://www.meetup.com/Pvdbikejam/) ride which ended around 10:30 PM. Because PBJ is such a ridiculously fun time, I completely lost track of time and was still pedaling when the clock struck ten. Fortunately, the bike didn't cut off power and it allowed me to finish the ride, but once I stopped it started chirping at me. The ride had been going for more than three hours at this point, so I figured it had reached some sort of limit and just wanted me to stop the ride and restart it (the app didn't alert me that the system was "closed" at this time). When I tried to restart the ride, I found I couldn't because it was too late in the evening. I was immediately frustrated with myself for forgetting that bikes couldn't be unlocked after 10, but then had the sinking thought: *how am I going to get home?* (PBJ customarily ends its rides at a bar or restaurant, and usually I hang around to chat with people for a few minutes before heading home.) RIPTA doesn't run very good late-night service (in my case, there were no buses coming until the following morning), and Spin's scooters also lock up at 10 PM. I ended up walking home, which took slightly less than an hour. I regularly take solo nighttime walks all over the city and didn't have to get home by and specific time, so this was more a frustration and inconvenience than anything, but I could see how for others or in other situations, this seemingly arbitrary 10 PM cutoff could result in someone being "stranded."

During the seven hours between 10 and 5 (when they mainly just sit where they were locked) the bikes and scooters are not earning Spin any revenue, so I have to imagine that the company would be willing to expend service hours at least somewhat. Regardless, the City should update its regulations to allow for 24-hour systems.

#### Place Restrictions

Shown in Spin's app are a number of no-park zones and no-ride zones, which are (in my understanding) defined by the City. Some of these, mainly the parking restrictions, make sense. You can't park (or in some cases, ride) along stretches of the Providence River, probably because Spin is worried about bikes and scooters falling in, a problem [not unique to Providence](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrxfT5EQxgI). Fine. You can't park within the footprint of the Providence Place Mall, probably because they don't want people riding through the mall or garage. Also fine. And, you can't park on State House Grounds or in Kennedy Plaza or Skating Rink area. Could be annoying, but you can park around the perimeter, so also fine.

In my memory, there used to be more no-ride zones, but at time of writing, there aren't too many of note. Most seem to be parking lots and highway on-ramps, for obvious reasons. The only other no-ride zone of note is the one that covers the Michael Van Leesten Pedestrian Bridge. I know why they do this from experience: the bridge is very popular for both oblivious pedestrians and inconsiderate daredevils. The City and Spin probably want to minimize their liabilities should a daring rider accidentally knock someone over or catapult themselves into the river. But while I can understand the reasoning behind this, I've got to say that as a *responsible* rider, trying to use as a piece of transportation infrastructure one of the few bridges in the city where you don't have to worry about getting run down by an SUV, having the bike's motors cut out halfway across is a terrible experience.[^bikes-dismount]

Unfortunately, I do see the merit in the bridge being a no-ride zone, even though I would like to be personally exempt from it. The only real solution is for the City to immediately begin building more car-free infrastructure so that everyone doesn't have to crowd onto the one bridge.

### "Backed by Ford Motor Company"

Spin has been a subsidiary of Ford [since it acquired the company in 2018](https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/news/2018/11/08/let_s-go-for-a-spin--ford-buys-scooter-company-to-provide-custom.html), a relationship which Spin displays prominently on its website. If I had to guess, Ford's ownership of the company appeals to cities that are eager to offer micromobility options, but do not have the resources to develop a system themselves and which are wary of less mature companies (like Uber, owner of JUMP). I'd also imagine that given that the public at large might be more willing to trust something if such a well-known company is behind it.

However, I see the fact that Spin is owned by Ford to be more of a cause for caution, if not an outright liability. A successful bikeshare, in my mind, is one that enables significant mode shift (people replacing trips they would normally make by private car with another mode of transportation). It's great if a bikeshare encourages people to make new trips they otherwise wouldn't (especially pleasure trips), but we as a society really need to get people cars and onto bikes and transit for the boring and unexciting trips they make every day, [many of which are short enough that they should be easy enough to accomplish by bike](https://www.energy.gov/eere/vehicles/articles/fotw-1042-august-13-2018-2017-nearly-60-all-vehicle-trips-were-less-six-miles). It isn't hard to think up a few reasons to question Ford's commitment.

#### Simple Conflict of Interest

It won't happen overnight, but Providence should be aiming to have a [mode share](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modal_share) of private car trips at least as low as Utrect, where less than 20% of trips are taken by private car and almost half of all trips are taken by bike. Of course, a mode shift of this scale would mean a drastically reduced demand for automobiles, which is the core of Ford's business. Because they are physically bigger and more technically complex, cars and trucks are always going to be more expensive than everyday bicycles. It makes sense that Ford may want a piece of micromobility profits (it's good PR that reads as vaguely environmental), but it just wouldn't make sense that Ford would *want* micromobility to begin to compete with its primary business.

#### Rumblings of Doubt

In May, [Bloomberg reported](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-20/ford-is-said-to-weigh-exit-of-electric-scooter-unit-spin) that Ford was considering divesting Spin:

  > New CEO Jim Farley is eliminating extraneous operations as he works to accelerate the automaker’s bet on electric vehicles, which he recently doubled to [$22 billion.](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-04/ford-beats-wall-street-profit-estimates-boosts-ev-spending) Argo AI, a self-driving startup backed by Ford and Volkswagen AG, is considering going public as soon as this year, Bloomberg News has [reported.](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-02/ford-backed-self-driving-startup-argo-ai-mulling-ipo-this-year)

  > Farley has honed Ford’s focus to electric and [autonomous](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-04/ford-backed-argo-sees-new-sensor-as-key-for-self-driving-cars) vehicles. The automaker on Wednesday introduced an electric version of its top-selling [F-150](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-20/ford-hopes-new-electric-f-150-pickup-will-boost-ev-street-cred) pickup, which President Joe Biden drove the day [before](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-18/biden-takes-ford-s-new-electric-f-150-for-surprise-spin-at-track), after touring the Michigan plant where it will be built.

This isn't shocking, given the conflict of interest I've outlined above. While the Biden Administration has taken a few pro-transit and pro-bike actions, and has even [hinted at funding urban highway removals](https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/trafficandcommuting/highway-removal-infrastructure/2021/03/31/effd6a26-9234-11eb-a74e-1f4cf89fd948_story.html), unfortunately (but perhaps not surprisingly) it has not significantly challenged the dominant role of the auto industry or automobile in American life. It is similarly unfortunate and unsurprising that Ford and its peers would use the opportunity to focus electrification (not trivial, but not really challenging or risky at this point) instead of mode shift.

#### Have We Been Here Before?

Micromobility is a rather turbulent business at the moment. Aaron Gordon wrote [an excellent piece on JUMP](https://www.vice.com/en/article/5dz94x/uber-acquisition-jump-bikeshare-destroyed-thousands-of-bikes) which covers challenges posed to JUMP both by "Uber’s bro culture and no-holds-barred approach to business" and by the frequent disruptive changes in the micromobility space itself. I think Ford definitely provides a different corporate environment for Spin than Uber did for JUMP, but as I've mentioned, I'm not convinced that it's necessarily more conducive for a sustainable micromobility service.

But how about the industry as a whole? The City of Providence, amongst many other cities, has opted to operate under a permit-based approach rather than a partner-based one (see Gordon's article for more on this). I think for Providence, this is the right decision. In larger cities (New York, London, even Boston), having a single designated bikeshare makes sense, partially because density is high enough to support a fully docked system. In smaller cities looking to offer dockless bikeshare, the investment is a greater risk. It makes sense that they are (at least temporarily) adopting a regulatory role and letting the many competing startups come and go and be acquired, because it's still not clear where micromobility is heading. While I would personally love more of a commitment from the City, the hesitation after the bad experience with JUMP (which originally began as a partnership arrangement) is understandable.

I don't think Ford's presence via Spin has changed this dynamic. Certainly, Spin does feel like at least a slightly more stable company than JUMP ever did, but even if there weren't the above-outlined conflicts of interest and rumblings of doubt, I don't know if much would be different. Micromobility is just still too turbulent of an industry, and its future is too dependent on local, state, and national policy to really feel like a sure thing.

Though I have reservations on how long Spin will operate in Providence, it's here today, and you should give the S-300 a try. It's intriguing and fun, and cheap enough to try at least once (even if it's too pricy to use regularly).

I did send them an (admittedly long) list of questions, and haven't gotten answers back in over two weeks, despite a follow up email.

[^theoretically]: I say "theoretically" because this seemed to be the prevailing narrative at the time. It *does* seem plausible that the cable loop in the second version was more vulnerable to attack (say, by cable cutters) than the original mechanism (which was just a U-Lock-style metal shackle), but personally I think this was rather overblown, and puts too much blame in a technology while obscuring policy failure.

[^projo-good-clean-fun]: *The Providence Journal* discussed this in what is [perhaps the only "good" piece of local journalism published on the issue](https://www.providencejournal.com/news/20190828/for-most-providence-kids-bikes-are-about-good-clean-fun).

[^scooter-comparison]: The bikes are definitely offer more bang for the buck. They're faster (and thus can go further in a given period of time), can carry stuff in the basket, have motors better able to cope with steep inclines, have better acceleration, and are generally much more resilient to potholes. I've ridden scooters a few times in the absence of any bikeshare and have always wished instead that I was on a bike. <br>
  [The Mayor has said](https://www.providenceri.gov/mayor-elorza-announces-re-launch-electric-bike-share-providence/) that "having the choice of an e-bike or an e-scooter gives riders the opportunity to pick a vehicle that best fits their journey," but excluding a mobility challenge that would prevent someone from riding a bike but not a scooter, I can't imagine a single situation in which a scooter is the better (or more enjoyable) vehicle for the trip. They feel like toys, not in the fun sense, but in the inferior sense.

[^domestic]: I'm evaluating Spin's offering in a decidedly North American mindset. Partially, this is because I have never traveled abroad, and because there are externalities (like authoritarianism in China or excellent planning philosophy in the Netherlands) which make direct comparisons more difficult.

[^bikes-dismount]: For the same reason, when the bridge opened, the City had stationed a police officer on the bridge who, amongst other duties, had been instructed to ask bicyclists to dismount and walk their bikes across the bridge, even when it was easily possible to give all pedestrians a wide berth. Given that the bridge was designed for pedestrians *and* cyclists and because I thought myself a relatively coordinated rider, I found this to be absolutely infuriating.
